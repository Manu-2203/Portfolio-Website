# Portfolio-Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work, skills, and projects. It features a bold and quirky design aimed at making a lasting impression on recruiters and collaborators. The site includes sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. For the Contact section, I integrated Google Sheets to securely collect and store messages and contact details submitted via the form. This setup allows for easy management and real-time access to user submissions without requiring a separate backend.
